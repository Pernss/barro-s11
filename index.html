      <h1>Eiichiro Oda</h1>
      <h3 class="pt-5 pb-5">Manga Artist</h3>
      <h4 class="text-justify pt-3">Eiichiro Oda</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">Eiichiro Oda, born January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan, is a professional mangaka, best known as the creator of the manga One Piece.
        A dedicated writer and artist since adolescence, Oda began working for Shueisha's Shonen Jump at 17 and currently stands as one of the world's most prominent mangaka, earning an estimated ¥3.1 billion (US$26 million) per year.[3] Despite his rigorous work schedule, he maintains steady correspondence with fans (and the wider public) through both formal interviews and informal channels such as his SBS columns.
        He has been married to the model and actress Chiaki Inaba since November 2004, with whom he has two daughters.

      <h4 class="text-justify">Appearance</h4>
      <p class="text-justify">In real life, Oda is a Japanese man of average height, with few (if any) distinguishing features. When not in formal settings, he favors casual, Western-style clothing.
        Like most mangaka, Oda typically uses outlandish caricatures to represent himself in printed works. The most common of these is a striped tropical fish, best known for "giving" all of Oda's weekly comments in Shonen Jump's table of contents; in more detailed depictions (such as the Color Walks' Monochrome Talk headers), this fish is usually given human ears and affixed atop a human body like a mask.

      <h4 class="text-justify pb-4">History</h4>
      <p class="text-justify"><strong>Early Life</strong></p>
      <p class="text-justify">As a child, Oda read many different manga (the earliest he can recall being The Monster Kid). These - along with his father's oil-painting hobby - inspired his dream to become a mangaka, as he believed they made money for doing no "real" work. His favorite television show was Vicky the Viking, a European-coproduced anime which began his lifelong fascination with pirates.[21]
        In fifth grade, inspired by Weekly Shonen Jump bestseller Captain Tsubasa, he joined his school's soccer club.[12] It was around this time that Jump began serializing Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball; on reading its second chapter, Oda was instantly enthralled, and would be heavily influenced by Toriyama's art and storytelling sensibilities for years to come.
        Oda began drawing manga in earnest around his second year of junior high, developing ideas and sketches for a pirate serial that would, many years later, become One Piece.[22][23] During his first year of high school, he chose to quit soccer so he could focus wholly on manga.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify"><strong>Breakthrough: Wanted! (1992-1993)</strong></p>
      <p class="text-justify">In 1992, during his senior year of high school, the seventeen-year-old Oda took interest in Shueisha's prestigious Tezuka Awards. Having enjoyed Westerns since seeing Young Guns some time prior, he spent four months constructing his first full-length manga: Wanted!, a "Gag Western" with strong supernatural elements. Proud of his work, but concerned his parents and teachers might disapprove, he submitted it under the pseudonym Tsuki Himizu Kikondo (月火水木金土?).
        Ultimately, Wanted! was named Second Class (準入選 Jun-nyūsen?) in the 44th Tezuka Awards, alongside two other works. This won Oda a ¥500,000 cash prize and recognition from many industry professionals, and in early 1993 his work was published in Shueisha's ongoing Mezase Mangaka! (めざせ漫画家!?) series.[24] Around this time, Oda - under his real name - acceded to his first professional interview, published in Kumamoto City's most prominent newspaper.[25]
        In spring of 1993, Oda graduated high school and entered Kyushu Tokai University's architecture program. Soon after, he began submitting more work to Shueisha, unaware that his Tezuka honors had qualified him not for Weekly Shonen Jump, but its Monthly offshoot. On finding his next publication - God's Gift for the Future - in the Monthly line, he sought out the Weekly title's "proper" channel, the somewhat less-renowned Hop☆Step Awards.[6] That October, his Hop☆Step entry Ikki Yako won first place — his first unqualified success as a mangaka.[26]

      <p class="text-justify"><strong>One Piece (1997-Present)</strong></p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/2/21/Oda%27s_Work.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/289?cb=20130528170508" alt="" class="photo1 text-justify">
      <p class="text-justify">For Oda, constructing the first chapters of One Piece was relatively straightforward. Knowing Jump customarily gave any new serial around ten installments to gauge reader response, he (with Asada's help) refined the earlier portions of his concept material into eight chapters: seven for a largely self-contained "introduction" arc, and one beginning a second, more elaborate arc.
        In July of 1997, Weekly Shonen Jump #34 premiered the first of these chapters, once again titled Romance Dawn. To Oda's surprise - and delight - it ranked higher in fan response than any of its co-features, prefiguring the series' runaway success. In following years, One Piece would expand into a considerable franchise, receiving its first animated adaptation in 1998, a full-length anime series in 1999, and its first video game in 2000.
